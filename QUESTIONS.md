Questions:
- [x] can we combine grants structs
- [x] can we get rid of grant types?
- [ ] can we reduce the # of grant status?
- [ ] can we reduce # of roles (grantor / grantee)
- [ ] can we combine / reduce grant state
- [x] do we want to store grant recipients as array or mapping
  - [x] do we need to iterate over this in the contract logic (A: not)
- [x] can we remove "request payment"
  - [x] are we assuming that grant managers have robust offchain comm with grantees
  - [x] what if everyone is a grant manager?
- [x] can we remove Payments[] by having a "requesting" global state
  - [ ] grant managers approve / vote on the requested funds
  - [ ] if expires then can propose again
  - [ ] possibly use timestamp to avoid explicit states
- [x] can we remove multiple grant managers / voting / m-of-n and replace w/ msig?
- [x] use donor / grantee / manager
- [ ] maybe use a getter for total funded (diff for ERC20 vs ETH)

Design Question:
- [x] (A: not preferred) Currently, the grant manager is bound by the initial allocation %s, they can
  not re-allocate the funds to grantees. So if there are two grantees each
  50/50 and one sucks, the manager will be forced to refund 50% of the money,
  they can't give it to the other not sucky grantee.
  - [x] Should we allow the manager to re-allocate?
  - [x] OR should we just do this as separate contracts with a single address?
  - [x] We do want to be able to batch grants so they don't have to hit separate
    thresholds
- [ ] Maybe design a "Manager" interface that implements whitelists of grantees,
  whether or not we can re-allocate funds between grantees, etc...

Refunds:
- [x] Three refund operations:
  - [x] 1. The grant does not reach the funding goal in time.
    - [x] any donor can withdraw
    - [ ] bonus for auto-withdraw
  - [x] 2. The grant managers decides to refund the donors.
  - [x] 3. The grant reaches the funding goal, but funds are still remaining after a second expiration date
   - [ ] kill expiration on the grant contract which freezes all future payouts
  - [ ] !!!NOTE!!! auto triggered refunding halts previously approved but never claimed payouts.


Stretch Goal:
- [ ] can we outsource grantees / grant manager to a separate contract?
  - [ ] if we have one that makes sense as a sane default
  - [ ] what are all the interfaces between grantees / managers / grants?

TODO:
- [ ] partial refunds by tracking donations
- [ ] auto refund if expiration and target not reached
- [x] use counter for ID
- [ ] signal should be a function (yes or no)
- [x] uniqueness check on grantees
  - [x] also switch % to amount and check matches total

Notes:
- [x] spawn new contract for each grant
- [x] send ETH directly to grant

Spec Recommendations:
- [x] use clock not blocks

Bonus:
- [x] prevent duplicate addresses

FUND_THRESHOLD, // Funds unlocked if threshold met.
- time based expiration
FUNDER_VOTE,    // Funds unlocked if funders approve.
- funders become grant managers
- get votes based on donations
MANAGED,        // Funds unlocked by grant_managers.
- pre-selected grant managers
OPAQUE          // Other offchain method.
- ?


- [ ] Reject eth if currency is token.
- [ ] Fallback function for simple eth transfer
- [ ] Return the rest if over funded.
- [ ] Fixed sized grants you pre-populate on create
  - [ ] If dynamic sized grant you calculate.


- [ ] Consistent return value (funds or success/fail)?
- [ ] Sweep (accidental transfers)?
- [x] Grantee cannot be GrantManager.
